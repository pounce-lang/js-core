# Pounce-lang Docs
Syntax: the Pounce language is a concatinative language with a classically minimal syntax:
 * Clear Space is defined as space, tab, or new-line
 * Words are any series of visible characters, not including code comments, list delimiters or clear space
 * a Phrase is a series of words or lists separated by clear space
 * Code Comments are started with a `#` character and end with a new-line
 * Lists are delimited by square brackets `[` and `]` and contain any number of words or lists
 
Only the word `compose` is reserved and cannot be redefined.

## Core Words: definitions, usage and meaning
Each core word is categorized and discussed in context of usage.

Categories: Arithmetic, String, Stack, List, Flow and Introspection

### words `[Introspection]`
This word lists all words in the core dictionary with the exception of `compose`.

### compose [Flow]
The only reserved word in Pounce, `compose` is processed before runtime. It affects the word dictionary and it consumes its stack arguments. It can not be used in a list, so it must be used at the outer most (base) level of a program. 
> [a phrase of words] [name-of-word] compose

> [1 +] [increment-by-one] compose

`compose`, stores a phrase of words as a named-word in the runtime word dictionary

### leap [Flow]
The word 'leap' concatinates words onto the running program. A list containing a phrase is dequoted prepended at the beginning of the program.
> [a phrase of words] leap

> [1 1 +] leap # Yeilds `2` on the stack

`leap` is equivalent to the Joy language word `i`

### pounce [Flow]
The word `pounce` first moves stack values into the phrase and then concatinates the modified words onto the running program. A list of named stack references and a list containing a phrase to be dequoted and prepended at the beginning of the program.
> [a etc] [a phrase of words] pounce

> 3 2 [a b] [b a -] pounce # Yeilds `-1` on the stack

`pounce` is equivilant to `crouch leap`
